# 🏹 Reflections

The site is a faithful reproduction of the previous project I made using vanilla javascript alone in week03. I would have liked to have added more to the project given time such as themes and sound, as well as implementing my own api.

Using for this project initially felt very awkward and cumbersome, achieving the same results as before took a greater level of complexity to implement due to Reacts rendering and re-rendering as well as component lifecycle. This was quite disheartening at first, but as got towards finishing the project and felt more comfortable with React the complexity felt less cumbersome and I learned to appreciate some of the simplification that React offers elsewhere such as providing HTML elements through JSX, segmentation of codebase, and not literring javscript with document getElement calls and event handlers.
